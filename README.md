# Netflix Clone made with ReactJS

![Redux](public/favicon.ico) &nbsp; <img src="public/logo192.png" width="70" alt="Netflix">

In this build, the following was done:
- Use of React, React-Router, Redux and other useful libraries
- Login and Logout Authentication with Google Firebase
- Axios was used for fetching requests for the information of Movies and TV Shows
- Home Screen with a similar look to that of Netflix using TMDB API
- Profile Page with the user information and Plans (**Need to still create**)
- Firestore Database to store the User Data
- Firebase Hosting of this Web Application

*For the Plans section, I intend to use Stripe Payments Extension through Firebase.*
